INSTRUCTIONS

This plugin is a helper to the TinyMCE Format Block select list. It enables
you to edit several common attributes of block (p, div, h1-6 etc) elements, 
such as title, id, class and style.

Add 'blockproperties' to your loaded plugins and to your toolbar button row.
eg

tinyMCE.init({
        theme : "Love",
        mode : "textareas",
        plugins : "blockproperties",
        theme_advanced_buttons3_add : "blockproperties"
});

Adding 'blockproperties' to your buttons next to the 'formatblock' entry
makes the the UI a little more intuitive.

To use, simply place the cursor within the block element you wish to edit
and click the button. The element selected will be the block element 
immediately containing the current cursor position.
